Hi there, I'm Abba! 👋

I'm a final-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Howard University, passionate about VLSI design, AI applications, and embedded systems. My interests lie in low-power VLSI design for sustainability and automation.

🔧 Technologies & Tools

Programming: Verilog, Python, C++, MATLAB

Hardware: FPGA (Nexys A7), Embedded Systems, Microcontrollers

EDA Tools: Xilinx Vivado

AI & Automation: Generative AI, Machine Learning, Data Analysis

Collaboration & Development: Git, Agile Methodologies, Jira, Confluence

🚀 Experience & Projects

Johnson & Johnson (Solution Engineering Intern): Worked on an AI-powered tool to automate release notes for the iConnect project, developed a new project checklist for the team, and prepared monthly metrics.

Research & Tutoring: Assisted students as a tutor in the College of Engineering and Architecture, reinforcing my knowledge while helping others succeed.

Senior Design Project: Developing a drone with an obstacle avoidance system using the Lynxmotion HQuad500 Drone Base Combo Kit and integrating real-time alerts.

🎯 Future Goals

I plan to pursue a Master’s in Electrical/Computer Engineering with a specialization in VLSI, exploring cutting-edge semiconductor technologies and sustainable design principles.
