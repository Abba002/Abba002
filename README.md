# Hi there, I'm Abba! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final-year Computer Engineering student at Howard University, passionate about VLSI design, AI applications, and embedded systems. My interests lie in low-power VLSI design for sustainability and automation.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

- **Programming:** Verilog, Python, C++, MATLAB  
- **Hardware:** FPGA (Nexys A7), Embedded Systems, Microcontrollers  
- **EDA Tools:** Xilinx Vivado  
- **AI & Automation:** Generative AI, Machine Learning, Data Analysis  
- **Collaboration & Development:** Git, Agile Methodologies, Jira, Confluence  

## ðŸš€ Experience & Projects

- **FPGA Projects:** Designed and implemented a **binary counter** and a **counter with reset** using Verilog on the Nexys A7 FPGA board.
- **Johnson & Johnson (Solution Engineering Intern):** Worked on an AI-powered tool to automate release notes for the iConnect project, developed a new project checklist for the team, and prepared monthly metrics.
- **Research & Tutoring:** Assisted students as a tutor in the College of Engineering and Architecture, reinforcing my knowledge while helping others succeed.
- **Senior Design Project:** Developing a drone with an obstacle avoidance system using the Lynxmotion HQuad500 Drone Base Combo Kit and integrating real-time alerts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals

I plan to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Electrical/Computer Engineering with a specialization in VLSI, exploring cutting-edge semiconductor technologies and sustainable design principles.
